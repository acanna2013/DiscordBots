# Background 
This is my first time working with JS, and I wanted to dip my toes into JS, so I decided to work on a project I was interested in. As someone who enjoys playing video games with friends over Discord, a social messaging app common among gamers, I focused on creating a working Discord Bot to enhance our gaming experiences. 

# Examples of What the Bot Can Do

As soon as a new user joins the Discord server, they are greeted by the bot and are assigned a randomly generated color.\

The bot also automatically sends a message when a specific word is triggered. In this way, a user can potentially have a "conversation" with the bot.
